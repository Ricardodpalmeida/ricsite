Worked in a university call center answering frantic students' questions about campus locations, created marketing materials nobody read at Le Wagon, and participated in organizing festivals and publicity campaigns for Sagres, but ended up doing powerpoints about lemon beer packaging. A character-building odyssey that taught me patience, resilience, and how to smile while a tourist explains that in Portugal it's called a 'galão' not a 'meia de leite'."
