Thank you for visiting my blog. I'm currently working on creating valuable content that I'll be sharing here soon.

## How to Add Images to Blog Posts

You can add images to your blog posts using standard markdown syntax:

![Example image description](/images/blog/coming-soon.jpg)

Or you can use HTML for more control over the image:

<img src="/images/blog/coming-soon.jpg" alt="Example image with HTML" width="400" />

## Including Code Samples

Code blocks are also supported:

```javascript
function greeting() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
